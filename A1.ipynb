    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the 2016 Q3, 2016 Q4, and 2017 Toronto Bikeshare ridership data available at [https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/ to answer the following questions](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Station information, including real time data, is available at [https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto/](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-toronto-bike-share-ridership-using-python-3dc87d35cb62) was written on the 2017 data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical weather data is available from a Government of Canada [website](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=51459&timeframe=2&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2019&Day=22&Year=2017&Month=1#). The weather data will need to be scraped (and not downloaded as csv files), then merged with the ridership data.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Python and Markdown in a Jupyter notebook to answer the following questions. In all of the questions below interpret your results, and identify limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Check the Law and Regulations on the [Historical Climate Data website](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/). Describe in a few sentences what you can and can't do with the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Read through the questions below. (i) Create a brief plan of the variables that you plan to use to answer these questions, (ii) explore the variables using quantitative and visual methods, and (iii) rectify any inconsistencies you find through exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Define trip length in two ways. Create a variable in the data set where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Is there a relationship between your two definitions of trip length? \n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** Do casual users take shorter trips compared to members? Answer to this question using both definitions from Question 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.** Does season or weather affect trip length? Answer to this question using both definitions from Question 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Answer each question, and build a cohesive report using Markdown and Code cells.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **You are required to scrape the wheather data from the website directly.** Note that if you are stuck with the scraping, you can still answer Question 6 by downloading csv files of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How should the data be analysed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers to the questions above can use a variety of statistical methods. Be sure to explore the data using numerical and graphical methods. You can use methods that we have not covered in class if you wish. But, it's a good idea to check with an instructor or TA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most questions involving data analysis can have multiple appropriate answers. There is no one correct answer to these questions, and there are several appropriate answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions in this handout are just seed questions. You are required to explore each question in as much depth as possible, asking follow-up questions, and/or looking at the same question from multiple perspectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What should the report contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "The report should contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Title.** There should be an appropriate title, adequate summary, and complete information including your name and date.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Introduction.** The purpose of the research should be clearly stated and the scope of what is considered in the report should be clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Methods.** The role of each method should be clearly stated. The description of the analyses should be clear and unambiguous so that another data scientist could easily why you selected these methods. The methods should be described accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Results.** There should be appropriate tables and graphs. The results should be clearly stated in the context of the problem. The size and direction of significant results should be given. The results must be accurately stated. The research question should be adequately answered using the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conclusion / Discussion.** The results should be clearly and completely summarized. This section should also include a discussion of limitations and/or concerns and/or suggestions for future consideration as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Considerations.** The ideas should be presented in logical order, with well-organized sections, no grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors, an appropriate level of technical detail, and be clear and easy to follow. Refer to the [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-toronto-bike-share-ridership-using-python-3dc87d35cb62) for an example of a good data science report.\n",

    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "**What should be submitted?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Jupyter notebook using Python that contains all the data analyses. The flow of the notebook should be Markdown and Code cells weaved together. In addition make sure to comment your code in the code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Additional files that your notebook requires to compile properly (e.g. a data file).\n",
    "\n",
    "* A report from your Jupyter notebook exported as a html file without the code cells. This can be done using [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where should the assignment be submitted?**\n",
    "* Commit your finished notebook (in both ipynb and html format) and any other files on the Github Classroom repository: [https://classroom.github.com/a/WObinpbJ](https://classroom.github.com/a/WObinpbJ)\n",
    "* Submit a pdf version of your notebook to Quercus (use \"Print to pdf\" of your html notebook).\n",
